          Local Storage: persistant and scoped to the domain(store data with no expiration date). At the moment two flavors are usually mentioned: <br>
          'default': stores things in name/value pairs. <br>
          Web SQL (aka Web Database): uses a SQL database. <br>

          Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS links between head /head and JS scripts just before /body? Do you know any exceptions?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Placing links in the head: Putting links in the head is part of the specification. Besides that, placing at the top allows the page to render progressively which improves user experience. The problem with putting stylesheets near the bottom of the document is that it prohibits progressive rendering in many browsers, including Internet Explorer. Some browsers block rendering to avoid having to repaint elements of the page if their styles change. The user is stuck viewing a blank white page. It prevents the flash of unstyled contents.<br>
          Placing scripts just before /body: scripts block HTML parsing while they are being downloaded and executed. Downloading the scripts at the bottom will allow the HTML to be parsed and displayed to the user first.<br>
          An exception for positioning of scripts at the bottom is when your script contains document.write(), but these days it's not a good practice to use document.write(). Also, placing scripts at the bottom means that the browser cannot start downloading the scripts until the entire document is parsed. One possible workaround is to put script in the head and use the defer attribute. </p>

          What is progressive rendering?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Progressive rendering is the name given to techniques used to improve performance of a webpage (in particular, improve perceived load time) to render content for display as quickly as possible.<br>
          It used to be much more prevalent in the days before broadband internet but it is still useful in modern development as mobile data connections are becoming increasingly popular (and unreliable)! <br>
          Examples of such techniques: <br>
          Lazy loading of images: Images on the page are not loaded all at once. JavaScript will be used to load an image when the user scrolls into the part of the page that displays the image.<br>
          Prioritizing visible content (or above-the-fold rendering): Include only the minimum CSS/content/scripts necessary for the amount of page that would be rendered in the users browser first to display as quickly as possible, you can then use deferred scripts or listen for the DOMContentLoaded/load event to load in other resources and content. <br>
          Async HTML fragments: Flushing parts of the HTML to the browser as the page is constructed on the back end.

          Why you would use a srcset attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          You would use the srcset attribute when you want to serve different images to users depending on their device display width - serve higher quality images to devices with retina display enhances the user experience while serving lower resolution images to low-end devices increase performance and decrease data wastage (because serving a larger image will not have any visible difference). <br> For example: <br> img srcset="small.jpg 500w, medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 2000w" src="..." alt="" tells the browser to display the small, medium or large .jpg graphic depending on the client's resolution. The first value is the image name and the second is the width of the image in pixels. For a device width of 320px, the following calculations are made: <br>
          500 / 320 = 1.5625 <br>
          1000 / 320 = 3.125 <br>
          2000 / 320 = 6.25 <br>
          If the client’s resolution is 1x, 1.5625 is the closest, and 500w corresponding to small.jpg will be selected by the browser. <br>
          If the resolution is retina (2x), the browser will use the closest resolution above the minimum. Meaning it will not choose the 500w (1.5625) because it is greater than 1 and the image might look bad. The browser would then choose the image with a resulting ratio closer to 2 which is 1000w (3.125). <br>
          srcsets solve the problem whereby you want to serve smaller image files to narrow screen devices, as they don't need huge images like desktop displays do — and also optionally that you want to serve different resolution images to high density/low-density screens.

        What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS selectors.<br>
          How is specificity calculated? Specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, determined by the number of each selector type in the matching selector. When multiple declarations have equal specificity, the last declaration found in the CSS is applied to the element. Specificity only applies when the same element is targeted by multiple declarations. As per CSS rules, directly targeted elements will always take precedence over rules which an element inherits from its ancestor.

        What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          CSS resets aim to remove all built-in browser styling. Standard elements like H1-6, p, strong, em, et cetera end up looking exactly alike, having no decoration at all. You're then supposed to add all decoration yourself.<br>
          Normalize CSS aims to make built-in browser styling consistent across browsers. Elements like H1-6 will appear bold, larger et cetera in a consistent way across browsers. You're then supposed to add only the difference in decoration your design needs.<br>
          I would use normalize because gives developers a safe starting point at which to know styles are the same across browsers.

        Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
        The stacking context:
        The stacking context is a three-dimensional conceptualization of HTML elements along an imaginary z-axis relative to the user, who is assumed to be facing the viewport or the webpage. HTML elements occupy this space in priority order based on element attributes.<br>
        The stacking context: Using z-index, the rendering order of certain elements is influenced by their z-index value. This occurs because these elements have special properties which cause them to form a stacking context.A stacking context is formed, anywhere in the document, by any element in the following scenarios:
        Root element of the document (html).<br>
        Element with a position value absolute or relative and z-index value other than auto. <br>
        Element with a position value fixed or sticky (sticky for all mobile browsers, but not older desktop). <br>
        Element that is a child of a flex container, with z-index value other than auto. <br>
        Element that is a child of a grid container, with z-index value other than auto. <br>
        Element with a opacity value less than 1. <br>
        Element with a mix-blend-mode value other than normal. <br>
        Element with any of the following properties with value other than none: <br>
        transform <br>
        filter <br>
        perspective <br>
        clip-path <br>
        mask / mask-image / mask-border <br>
        Element with a isolation value isolate. <br>
        Element with a -webkit-overflow-scrolling value touch. <br>
        Element with a will-change value specifying any property that would create a stacking context on non-initial value (see this post). <br>
        Element with a contain value of layout, or paint, or a composite value that includes either of them (i.e. contain: strict, contain: content). <br>
        Within a stacking context, child elements are stacked according to the same rules previously explained. Importantly, the z-index values of its child stacking contexts only have meaning in this parent. Stacking contexts are treated automically as a single unit in the parent stacking context. <br>
        In summary: <br>
        Stacking contexts can be contained in other stacking contexts, and together create a hierarchy of stacking contexts. <br>
        Each stacking context is completely independent of its siblings: only descendant elements are considered when stacking is processed. <br>
        Each stacking context is self-contained: after the element's contents are stacked, the whole element is considered in the stacking order of the parent stacking context. <br>

        Describe BFC (Block Formatting Context) and how it works.
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          A block formatting context is a part of a visual CSS rendering of a web page. It's the region in which the layout of block boxes occurs and in which floats interact with other elements. <br>
          A block formatting context is created by at least one of the following: <br>
          The root element of the document (html). <br>
          Floats (elements where float isn't none). <br>
          Absolutely positioned elements (elements where position is absolute or fixed).<br>
          Table cells (elements with display: table-cell, which is the default for HTML table cells).<br>
          Inline-blocks (elements with display: inline-block).<br>
          Table captions (elements with display: table-caption, which is the default for HTML table captions).<br>
          Anonymous table cells implicitly created by the elements with display: table, table-row, table-row-group, table-header-group, table-footer-group (which is the default for HTML tables, table rows, table bodies, table headers, and table footers, respectively), or inline-table.<br>
          Block elements where overflow has a value other than visible and clip.<br>
          display: flow-root.<br>
          Elements with contain: layout, content, or paint.<br>
          Flex items (direct children of the element with display: flex or inline-flex) if they are neither flex nor grid nor table containers themselves.<br>
          Grid items (direct children of the element with display: grid or inline-grid) if they are neither flex nor grid nor table containers themselves.<br>
          Multicol containers (elements where column-count or column-width isn't auto, including elements with column-count: 1).<br>
          column-span: all should always create a new formatting context, even when the column-span: all element isn't contained by a multicol container (Spec change, Chrome bug).<br>
          Formatting contexts affect layout, but typically, we create a new block formatting context for the positioning and clearing floats rather than changing the layout, because an element that establishes a new block formatting context will:<br>
          Contain internal floats.<br>
          Exclude external floats.<br>
          Suppress margin collapsing.<br>

        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          CSS sprites combine multiple images into one single larger image. It is commonly used technique for icons (Gmail uses it). <br> How to implement it:
          Use a sprite generator that packs multiple images into one and generate the appropriate CSS for it.<br>
          Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with background-image, background-position and background-size properties defined.<br>
          To use that image, add the corresponding class to your element.<br>
          Advantages:<br>
          Reduce the number of HTTP requests for multiple images (only one single request is required per spritesheet). But with HTTP2, loading multiple images is no longer much of an issue.<br>
          Advance downloading of assets that won’t be downloaded until needed, such as images that only appear upon :hover pseudo-states. Blinking wouldn’t be seen.

          visibility: hidden. However the element is still in the flow of the page, and still takes up space. <br>
          width: 0; height: 0. Make the element not take up any space on the screen at all, resulting in not showing it. <br>
          position: absolute; left: -99999px. Position it outside of the screen. <br>
          text-indent: -9999px. This only works on text within the block elements. <br>
          Metadata. For example by using Schema.org, RDF and JSON-LD.
          WAI-ARIA. A W3C technical specification that specifies how to increase the accessibility of web pages. <br>
          Even if WAI-ARIA is the ideal solution, I would go with the absolute positioning approach, as it has the least caveats, works for most elements and it’s an easy technique.

      Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Grid systems usually come with a myriad of sizing options, but the vast majority of the time you just want two or three elements side-by-side. Given this, why should we be required to put sizing classes on every single cell? <br>
          Listed below are some of my criteria for an ideal grid system. Fortunately, with Flexbox we get most of these features for free. <br>
          By default, each grid cell is the same width and height as every other cell in the row. Basically they all size to fit by default. <br>
          For finer control, you can add sizing classes to individual cells. Without these classes, the cells simply divide up the available space as usual. <br>
          For responsive grids, you can add media query-specific classes to the cells. <br>
          Individual cells can be aligned vertically to the top, bottom, or middle. <br>
          When you want all of the cells in a grid to have the same sizing, media, or alignment values, you should be able to just add a single class to the container to avoid unnecessary repetition. <br>
          Grids can be nested as many levels deep as needed. <br>
          I prefer Flexbox.

      What are some of the "gotchas" for writing efficient CSS?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Use efficient CSS selectors.<br>
          Avoid a universal key selector.<br>
          Allow elements to inherit from ancestors, or use a class to apply a style to multiple elements.<br>
          Make your rules as specific as possible.<br>
          Prefer class and ID selectors over tag selectors.<br>
          Remove redundant qualifiers.<br>
          These qualifiers are redundant:<br>
          ID selectors qualified by class and/or tag selectors.<br>
          Class selectors qualified by tag selectors (when a class is only used for one tag, which is a good design practice anyway).<br>
          Avoid using descendant selectors, especially those that specify redundant ancestors.
          For example, the rule body ul li a {...} specifies a redundant body selector, since all elements are descendants of the body tag.<br>
          Use class selectors instead of descendant selectors.<br>
          Avoid CSS expressions.<br>

      What are the advantages/disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
      What are the advantages/disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors? Option to add variables, mixins and functions for code reusability. <br>
      Basic CSS is direct and offers less flexibility. With CSS Preprocessor, we can add variables and functions which facilitates easier and efficient development. It also makes our code more organised and clean.<br>
      Hierarchy:<br>
      With CSS preprocessors it is easy to group parent and child elements into modular blocks which allow us to manage code easily. It’s easier to write styles for nested components using preprocessor and also the code becomes easier to maintain.<br>
      Easy to join multiple files.<br>
      CSS Preprocessors offers a special functionality of joining multiple stylesheets into one. We can create different files for each screen or pages and then import them all in the main CSS file.<br>
      After that, only the main file needs to be imported on the website and internal files will be read from the server.<br>
      A major advantage of this approach is that multiple calls to the server for CSS files are avoided.<br>
      Disadvantages of using CSS Preprocessors:<br>
      Compilation takes longer time.<br>
      Compilation times can be really slow, even when using the best tool, mainly because SASS compiler run every time we make file minor file changes. We know that feeling when live reload takes a lot of time while developing website mainly because every SASS file needs to be converted into CSS before the output can be shown on the browser.<br>
      They can produce very large CSS files.<br>
      Source files may be small, but the generated CSS could be huge which can increase time for the request to complete.<br>
      Extra Tooling and developer inconvenience.<br>
      CSS preprocessors require extra tooling and knowledge about using the preprocessor properly.<br> These preprocessors need to be understood and their corresponding libraries need to be maintained and upgraded from time to time.<br>

        <p class="faq-text">
          As the browser parses HTML, it constructs an internal document tree representing all the elements to be displayed. It then matches elements to styles specified in various stylesheets, according to the standard CSS cascade, inheritance, and ordering rules. In Mozilla's implementation (and probably others as well), for each element, the CSS engine searches through style rules to find a match. The engine evaluates each rule from right to left, starting from the rightmost selector (called the "key") and moving through each selector until it finds a match or discards the rule. (The "selector" is the document element to which the rule should apply.)

        <p class="faq-text">
          A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s).

          :first-line and :first-letter can be used to decorate text.<br>
          Used in the .clearfix hack as shown above to add a zero-space element with clear: both.<br>
          Triangular arrows in tooltips use :before and :after. Encourages separation of concerns because the triangle is considered part of styling and not really the DOM. It’s not really possible to draw a triangle with just CSS styles without using an additional HTML element.

        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in the document tree and laid out according to the visual formatting model. Each box has a content area (e.g. text, an image, etc.) and optional surrounding padding, border, and margin areas.<br>
          The CSS box model is responsible for calculating:<br>
          How much space a block element takes up.<br>
          Whether or not borders and/or margins overlap, or collapse.<br>
          A box’s dimensions.<br>
          The box model has the following rules:<br>
          The dimensions of a block element are calculated by width, height, padding, borders, and margins.<br>
          If no height is specified, a block element will be as high as the content it contains, plus padding.<br>
          If no width is specified, a non-floated block element will expand to fit the width of its parent minus padding.<br>
          The height of an element is calculated by the content’s height.<br>
          The width of an element is calculated by the content’s width.<br>
          By default, paddings and borders are not part of the width and height of an element.<br>

          absolute: The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to its closest positioned ancestor if any, or otherwise relative to the initial containing block. Absolutely positioned boxes can have margins, and they do not collapse with any other margins. These elements do not affect the position of other elements.<br>
          fixed: The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to the viewport and doesn’t move when scrolled.<br>
          sticky: Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.

          Flexbox solves many common problems in CSS, such as vertical centering of elements within a container, sticky footer, etc. Bootstrap and Bulma are based on Flexbox, and it is probably the recommended way to create layouts these days. Have tried Flexbox before but ran into some browser incompatibility issues (Safari) in using flex-grow, and I had to rewrite my code using inline-blocks and math to calculate the widths in percentages, it wasn’t a nice experience.<br>

Responsive means you only need one website and you write the code for responding to different sizes in the CSS.<br>
          Mobile first is an approach to a website that instead of designing a website to look good on a desktop computer, they take a more progressive approach and make a site to look good on a mobile device first before adapting it later to fit a desktop layout.

        How is responsive design different from adaptive design?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Both responsive and adaptive design attempt to optimize the user experience across different devices, adjusting for different viewport sizes, resolutions, usage contexts, control mechanisms, and so on. <br>
          Responsive design works on the principle of flexibility — a single fluid website that can look good on any device. Responsive websites use media queries, flexible grids, and responsive images to create a user experience that flexes and changes based on a multitude of factors. Like a single ball growing or shrinking to fit through several different hoops.<br>
          Adaptive design is more like the modern definition of progressive enhancement. Instead of one flexible design, adaptive design detects the device and other features, and then provides the appropriate feature and layout based on a predefined set of viewport sizes and other characteristics. The site detects the type of device used, and delivers the pre-set layout for that device. Instead of a single ball going through several different-sized hoops, you’d have several different balls to use depending on the hoop size.

          I tend to use higher resolution graphics (twice the display size) to handle retina display. The better way would be to use a media query like @media only screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) { ... } and change the background-image. <br>
          For icons, I would also opt to use svgs and icon fonts where possible, as they render very crisply regardless of resolution. <br>
          Another method would be to use JavaScript to replace the img src attribute with higher resolution versions after checking the window.devicePixelRatio value.

        Is there any reason you'd want to use translate() instead of absolute positioning, or vice-versa? And why?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          translate() is a value of CSS transform. Changing transform or opacity does not trigger browser reflow or repaint, only compositions, whereas changing the absolute positioning triggers reflow. Transform causes the browser to create a GPU layer for the element but changing absolute positioning properties uses the CPU. Hence translate() is more efficient and will result in shorter paint times for smoother animations. <br>
          When using translate(), the element still takes up its original space (sort of like position: relative), unlike in changing the absolute positioning.

        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Event delegation is a technique involving adding event listeners to a parent element instead of adding them to the descendant elements. The listener will fire whenever the event is triggered on the descendant elements due to event bubbling up the DOM. The benefits of this technique are:<br>
          Memory footprint goes down because only one single handler is needed on the parent element, rather than having to attach event handlers on each descendant.<br>
          There is no need to unbind the handler from elements that are removed and to bind the event for new elements.

          The value of this depends on how the function is called.<br>
          If the new keyword is used when calling the function, this inside the function is a brand new object. <br>
          If apply, call, or bind are used to call/create a function, this inside the function is the object that is passed in as the argument. <br>
          If a function is called as a method, such as obj.method() — this is the object that the function is a property of. <br>
          If a function is invoked as a free function invocation, meaning it was invoked without any of the conditions present above, this is the global object. In a browser, it is the window object. If in strict mode ('use strict'), this will be undefined instead of the global object.<br>
          If multiple of the above rules apply, the rule that is higher wins and will set the this value. <br>
          If the function is an ES2015 arrow function, it ignores all the rules above and receives the this value of its surrounding scope at the time it is created.

        <p class="faq-text">
          All JavaScript objects have a prototype property, that is a reference to another object. When a property is accessed on an object and if the property is not found on that object, the JavaScript engine looks at the object’s prototype, and the prototype‘s prototype and so on, until it finds the property defined on one of the prototypes or until it reaches the end of the prototype chain. This behaviour simulates classical inheritance, but it is really more of delegation than inheritance.

        What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Both are ways to implement a module system, which was not natively present in JavaScript until ES2015 came along. CommonJS is synchronous while AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) is obviously asynchronous. CommonJS is designed with server-side development in mind while AMD, with its support for asynchronous loading of modules, is more intended for browsers.<br>
          I find AMD syntax to be quite verbose and CommonJS is closer to the style you would write to import statements in other languages. Most of the time, I find AMD unnecessary, because if you served all your JavaScript into one concatenated bundle file, you wouldn’t benefit from the async loading properties. Also, CommonJS syntax is closer to Node style of writing modules and there is less context-switching overhead when switching between client side and server side JavaScript development. <br>
          I’m glad that with ES2015 modules, that has support for both synchronous and asynchronous loading, we can finally just stick to one approach. Although it hasn’t been fully rolled out in browsers and in Node, we can always use transpilers to convert our code.

          IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expressions.

          Here are two ways to fix it that involves adding more brackets: (function foo(){ })() and (function foo(){ }()). These functions are not exposed in the global scope and you can even omit its name if you do not need to reference itself within the body.

Invoking as such is a common mistake if it the function is intended to be used as a constructor. <br> Typically, the constructor does not return anything, hence invoking the constructor like a normal function will return undefined and that gets assigned to the variable intended as the instance. <br>

        <p class="faq-text">
          Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute JSON for XML due to the advantages of being native to JavaScript. <br>

         The only time you may want to extend a native object is when you want to create a polyfill, essentially providing your own implementation for a method that is part of the JavaScript specification but might not exist in the user’s browser due to it being an older browser.

          The DOMContentLoaded event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.
          The window‘s load event is only fired after the DOM and all dependent resources and assets have loaded.

          ‘use strict’ is a statement used to enable strict mode to entire scripts or individual functions. Strict mode is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript.<br>
          Advantages: <br>
          Makes it impossible to accidentally create global variables. <br>
          Makes assignments which would otherwise silently fail to throw an exception. <br>
          Makes attempts to delete undeletable properties throw (where before the attempt would simply have no effect). <br>

        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Web developers these days refer to the products they build as web apps, rather than websites. While there is no strict difference between the two terms, web apps tend to be highly interactive and dynamic, allowing the user to perform actions and receive a response for their action. Traditionally, the browser receives HTML from the server and renders it. When the user navigates to another URL, a full-page refresh is required and the server sends fresh new HTML for the new page. This is called server-side rendering. <br>
          However in modern SPAs, client-side rendering is used instead. The browser loads the initial page from the server, along with the scripts (frameworks, libraries, app code) and stylesheets required for the whole app. When the user navigates to other pages, a page refresh is not triggered. The URL of the page is updated via the HTML5 History API. New data required for the new page, usually in JSON format, is retrieved by the browser via AJAX requests to the server. The SPA then dynamically updates the page with the data via JavaScript, which it has already downloaded in the initial page load. This model is similar to how native mobile apps work.

          Some common polyfills are $.deferred, Q and Bluebird but not all of them comply to the specification. ES2015 supports Promises out of the box and polyfills are typically not needed these days.

        Advantages: <br>
        Fixes some of the longstanding problems in JavaScript and discourages JavaScript anti-patterns.
        Enables you to write shorter code, by providing some syntactic sugar on top of JavaScript..<br>
        Static types are awesome (in the case of TypeScript) for large projects that need to be maintained over time.<br>
        Disadvantages:<br>
        Require a build/compile process as browsers only run JavaScript and your code will need to be compiled into JavaScript before being served to browsers.<br>
        Debugging can be a pain if your source maps do not map nicely to your pre-compiled source.
        Most developers are not familiar with these languages and will need to learn it. There’s a ramp up cost involved for your team if you use it for your projects.<br>
        Smaller community (depends on the language), which means resources, tutorials, libraries and tooling would be harder to find.<br>
        IDE/editor support might be lacking.<br>

        What language constructions do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          For objects: <br>
          for loops: for (var property in obj) { console.log(property); }. However, this will also iterate through its inherited properties, and you will add an obj.hasOwnProperty(property) check before using it.<br>
          Object.keys(): Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... }). Object.keys() is a static method that will lists all enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.
          Object.getOwnPropertyNames() — Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... }). Object.getOwnPropertyNames() is a static method that will lists all enumerable and non-enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.<br>
          For arrays:<br>
          for loops: for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++). The common pitfall here is that var is in the function scope and not the block scope and most of the time you would want block scoped iterator variable. ES2015 introduces let which has block scope and it is recommended to use that instead. So this becomes: for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++).<br>
          forEach: arr.forEach(function (el, index) { ... }). This construct can be more convenient at times because you do not have to use the index if all you need is the array elements. There are also the every and some methods which will allow you to terminate the iteration early.

The callback is only invoked when the asynchronous operation is complete and the call stack is empty. Heavy duty operations such as loading data from a web server or querying a database should be done asynchronously so that the main thread can continue executing other operations instead of blocking until that long operation to complete.

Redeclaring a variable with var will not throw an error, but ‘let’ and ‘const’ will. let and const differ in that let allows reassigning the variable’s value while const does not.

        One of the primary use cases for traditional lambda functions, and now for arrow functions in JavaScript, is for functions that get applied over and over again to items in a list. A list of arguments within parenthesis, followed by a 'fat arrow' (=>), followed by a function body.<br>
        This is very similar to traditional functions, we just leave off the function keyword and add a fat arrow after the arguments.<br>
        However, there are a number of ways to 'sugar' this up that make arrow functions dramatically more concise for simple functions.<br>
        First, if the function body is a single expression, you can leave off the brackets and put it inline. The results of the expression will be returned by the function.<br>
        Second, if there is only a single argument, you can even leave off the parenthesis around the argument.<br>

          A higher-order function is any function that takes another function as a parameter, which it uses to operate on some data, or returns a function as a result. Higher-order functions are meant to abstract some operation that is performed repeatedly. The classic example of this is map, which takes an array and a function as arguments. map then uses this function to transform each item in the array, returning a new array with the transformed data. Other popular examples in JavaScript are forEach, filter, and reduce. A higher-order function doesn’t just need to be manipulating arrays as there are many use cases for returning a function from another function.

        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Currying is a pattern where a function with more than one parameter is broken into multiple functions that, when called in series, will accumulate all of the required parameters one at a time. This technique can be useful for making code written in a functional style easier to read and compose. It’s important to note that for a function to be curried, it needs to start out as one function, then broken out into a sequence of functions that each take one parameter.

          What are the benefits of using spread syntax and how is it different from rest syntax?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          ES6’s spread syntax is very useful when coding in a functional paradigm as we can easily create copies of arrays or objects without resorting to Object.create, slice, or a library function. This language feature gets a lot of use in projects using Redux or RX.js. ES6’s rest syntax offers a shorthand for including an arbitrary number of arguments to be passed to a function. It is like an inverse of the spread syntax, taking data and stuffing it into an array rather than upacking an array of data, and it works in function arguments, as well as in array and object destructuring assignments.

          How can you share code between files?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Almost every language has a concept of modules: a way to include functionality declared in one file within another. Typically, a developer creates an encapsulated library of code responsible for handling related tasks. That library can be referenced by applications or other modules.<br>
          The benefits: <br>
          Code can be split into smaller files of self-contained functionality. <br>
          The same modules can be shared across any number of applications. <br>
          Ideally, modules need never be examined by another developer, because they’ve has been proven to work. <br>
          Code referencing a module understands it’s a dependency. If the module file is changed or moved, the problem is immediately obvious. <br>
          Module code (usually) helps eradicate naming conflicts. Function x() in module1 cannot clash with function x() in module2. Options such as namespacing are employed so calls become module1.x() and module2.x().

        Why might you want to create static class members?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Neither static methods nor static properties can be called on instances of the class. Instead, they're called on the class itself. Static methods are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects, whereas static properties are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, or any other data you don't need to be replicated across instances. The advantage of using a static class is that the compiler can check to make sure that no instance members are accidentally added. The compiler will guarantee that instances of this class cannot be created. Static classes are sealed and therefore cannot be inherited. They cannot inherit from any class except Object.

          The process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.

        What are the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          OOP Pros: <br>
          Objects and methods are very readable and understandable. <br>
          OOP utilizes an imperative style, in which code reads like a straight-forward set of instructions as a computer would read it. <br>
          OOP Cons: <br>
          OOP commonly depends upon shareable state. The unfortunate result of so many objects and methods existing within the same state and being accessed in an entirely undetermined order can lead the pre-discussed concept of “race conditions”. <br>
          FP Pros: <br>
          Utilizing pure functions, leads to reliable functions with no side effects that accomplish and return exactly what you expect them to. <br>
          FP utilizes a more declarative style, which focuses more on what to do and less about how it’s being done. This places the emphasis on performance and optimization, leaving the door to refactor without completely reworking your code. <br>
          FP Cons: <br>
          Functional programming is a newer paradigm. It’s much easier to find documentation and information on the OOP approach. <br>
          Similar to one of OOP’s strengths, functional programming can lack readability at times. Sometimes functions can become very verbose and become difficult to follow comparatively to the object-oriented style. <br>
          You saw a simple example of this in the Person object and createPerson function we discussed earlier. <br>
          The Conclusion: Too often do we pit paradigms, languages, and other competitive programming concepts against one another. Often times, the best approach is that of the hybrid approach. Utilize Object-Oriented Programming in moments where its strengths can best shines. Utilize Functional Programming in moments where its strengths can best shine as well.

        What is asynchronous programming, and why is it important in JavaScript?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Asynchronous programming makes it possible to express waiting for long-running actions without freezing the program during these actions. JavaScript environments typically implement this style of programming using callbacks, functions that are called when the actions complete. An event loop schedules such callbacks to be called when appropriate, one after the other, so that their execution does not overlap. <br>
          Programming asynchronously is made easier by promises, objects that represent actions that might complete in the future, and async functions, which allow you to write an asynchronous program as if it were synchronous.

        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          JavaScript provides an easy way of escaping from a callback hell. This is done by event queue and promises.<br>
          A promise is a returned object from any asynchronous function, to which callback methods can be added based on the previous function’s result.<br>
          Promises use .then() method to call async callbacks. We can chain as many callbacks as we want and the order is also strictly maintained.<br>
          Promises use .fetch() method to fetch an object from the network. It also uses .catch() method to catch any exception when any block fails.<br>
          So these promises are put in event queue so that they don’t block subsequent JS code. Also once the results are returned, the event queue finishes its operations.<br>
          There are also other helpful keywords and methods like async, wait, settimeout() to simplify and make better use of callbacks.

        What are the functionalities of NPM in Node.js?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          npm is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management. A plethora of Node.js libraries and applications are published on npm, and many more are added every day. These applications can be searched for on https://www.npmjs.com/. Once you have a package you want to install, it can be installed with a single command-line command.<br>
          Let's say you're hard at work one day, developing the Next Great Application. You come across a problem, and you decide that it's time to use that cool library you keep hearing about - let's use Caolan McMahon's async as an example. Thankfully, npm is very simple to use: you only have to run npm install async, and the specified module will be installed in the current directory under ./node_modules/. Once installed to your node_modules folder, you'll be able to use require() on them just like they were built-ins.<br>
          Let's look at an example of a global install - let's say coffee-script. The npm command is simple: npm install coffee-script -g. This will typically install the program and put a symlink to it in /usr/local/bin/. This will then allow you to run the program from the console just like any other CLI tool. In this case, running coffee will now allow you to use the coffee-script REPL. <br>
          Another important use for npm is dependency management. When you have a node project with a package.json file, you can run npm install from the project root and npm will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json. This makes installing a Node.js project from a git repo much easier!

        What is the difference between Node.js and Ajax?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          The only similarity between AJAX and Node.js is that they are both JavaScript; yet they both serve completely different purposes. <br>
          AJAX (short for Asynchronous Javascript and XML) is a client-side technology, often used for updating the contents of a page without refreshing it. Such use can be seen just about everywhere; from Facebook, even to Stack Overflow.<br>
          Node.js is server-side JavaScript, used for developing server software. For example, you wouldn't want to develop a database system in client-side JS (since, well, anyone could access the database's credentials obviously), but such a task is possible with Node.js. Node.js doesn't get executed in a browser, but by a server - it's uses are very comparable to Apache/PHP, Ruby on Rails, Django, and the like. <br>

        What are “streams” in Node.js? Explain the different types of streams present in Node.js.
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Streams are a way to handle reading/writing files, network communications, or any kind of end-to-end information exchange in an efficient way.<br>
          What makes streams unique, is that instead of a program reading a file into memory all at once like in the traditional way, streams read chunks of data piece by piece, processing its content without keeping it all in memory. <br>
          Writable: streams to which we can write data. For example, fs.createWriteStream() lets us write data to a file using streams. <br>
          Readable: streams from which data can be read. For example: fs.createReadStream() lets us read the contents of a file.<br>
          Duplex: streams that are both Readable and Writable. For example, net.Socket <br>
          Transform: streams that can modify or transform the data as it is written and read. For example, in the instance of file-compression, you can write compressed data and read decompressed data to and from a file.

        <p class="faq-text">
          The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations — despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded — by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. <br>
          Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background. When one of these operations completes, the kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback may be added to the poll queue to eventually be executed. <br>
          When Node.js starts, it initializes the event loop, processes the provided input script (or drops into the REPL, which is not covered in this document) which may make async API calls, schedule timers, or call process.nextTick(), then begins processing the event loop.

        What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Asynchronous: The term itself defines that it is not synchronous. The architecture of asynchronous explains that the message sent will not give the reply on immediate basis just like we send the mail but do not get the reply on an immediate basis. It does not have any dependency or order. Hence improving the system efficiency and performance. The server stores the information and when the action is done it will be notified. <br>
          Non-Blocking: Nonblocking immediately responds with whatever data is available. Moreover, it does not block any execution and keeps on running as per the requests. If an answer could not be retrieved than in those cases API returns immediately with an error. Nonblocking is mostly used with I/O(input/output). Node.js is itself based on nonblocking I/O model. There are few ways of communication that a nonblocking I/O has completed. The callback function is to be called when the operation is completed. Nonblocking call uses the help of javascript which provides a callback function. You can point out the differences with these definitions of asynchronous and nonblocking. But few major differences are: <br> 1. Asynchronous does not respond immediately, while Nonblocking responds immediately if the data is available and if not that simply returns an error. <br> 2. Asynchronous improves the efficiency by doing the task fast as the response might come later, meanwhile, can do complete other tasks. Nonblocking does not block any execution and if the data is available it retrieves the information quickly. <br> 3. Asynchronous is the opposite of synchronous while nonblocking I/O is the opposite of blocking. They both are fairly similar but they are also different as asynchronous is used with a broader range of operations while nonblocking is mostly used with I/O.

Tracing offers a mechanism where information generated by V8, Userspace code and Node core can be traced at a central point.<br>
          Tracing is able to monitor your node applications by closely following JavaScript entry and exit points thereby, recording time that has passed to each function. You may not notice the effect of tracing during the first time but, afterward one can clearly tell its effects. It is possible to activate trace on a running Node.JS application or before the application has been started.

In this options object, you can specify the depth of your console log. <br> Debug in Chrome with inspect flag: you pass a flag to your node process before you start the Node application. This tells Node.js that you want to run in debugging mode. Node.js will then start a WebSocket connection that will allow you to remote debug from your browser. <br> IDE: These IDE tools work in much the same way as before. You’ll need to attach an inspector to your node process and then listen on the WebSocket that is created for your debugging purposes. To debug memory leaks, repeat the inspect step from tip four to open up Chrome. Once it’s opened, you will see a memory tab.

        Difference between setImmediate() vs setTimeout()?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          setImmediate() is similar in this regard except that it doesn't use queue of functions. It checks queue of I/O eventhandlers. If all I/O events in the current snapshot are processed, it executes the callback. It queues them immediately after the last I/O handler somewhat like process.nextTick. So it is faster. <br>
          setTimeout() is simply like calling the function after delay has finished. Whenever a function is called it is not executed immediately, but queued so that it is executed after all the executing and currently queued eventhandlers finish first. setTimeout(,0) essentially means execute after all current functions in the present queue get executed. No guarantees can be made about how long it could take.

        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          When we pass a function to process.nextTick(), we instruct the engine to invoke this function at the end of the current operation, before the next event loop tick starts: The event loop is busy processing the current function code.
          When this operation ends, the JS engine runs all the functions passed to nextTick() calls during that operation.
          It's the way we can tell the JS engine to process a function asynchronously (after the current function), but as soon as possible, not queue it.
          Calling setTimeout(() => {}, 0) will execute the function at the end of next tick, much later than when using nextTick() which prioritizes the call and executes it just before the beginning of the next tick.
          Use nextTick() when you want to make sure that in the next event loop iteration that code is already executed.

        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          All npm packages contain a file, usually in the project root, called package.json - this file holds various metadata relevant to the project. This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies. It can also contain other metadata such as a project description, the version of the project in a particular distribution, license information, even configuration data - all of which can be vital to both npm and to the end users of the package. The package.json file is normally located at the root directory of a Node.js project. As you can see, there are fields for the description and keywords of your projects. This allows people who find your project understand what it is in just a few words. The author, contributors, homepage and repository fields can all be used to credit the people who contributed to the project, show how to contact the author/maintainer, and give links for additional references. <br>
          The file listed in the main field is the main entry point for the library; when someone runs require(library name), require resolves this call to require(package.json:main).<br>
          Finally, the dependencies field is used to list all the dependencies of your project that are available on npm. When someone installs your project through npm, all the dependencies listed will be installed as well. Additionally, if someone runs npm install in the root directory of your project, it will install all the dependencies to ./node_modules.<br>
          It is also possible to add a devDependencies field to your package.json - these are dependencies not required for normal operation, but required/recommended if you want to patch or modify the project. If you built your unit tests using a testing framework, for example, it would be appropriate to put the testing framework you used in your devDependencies field. To install a project's devDependencies, simply pass the --dev option when you use npm install.

          LibUV is the core engine that powers Nodejs. LibUV provides support for asynchronous I/O operations. It’s a C based library primarily created for Nodejs and used by Luvit, Julia, pyuv, and some other software.
          LibUV enforces an asynchronous, event-driven style of programming. It uses event loops to handle asynchronous tasks effectively. It also supports non-blocking network support, asynchronous file system access, etc.
          By “event-driven” programming, we mean it watches for events to occur and then handle them when they occur. The monitoring of events happening in the system is managed by LibUV using something that we call Event Loop. This Event Loop usually keeps running forever.
          The responsibilities of LibUV are cross-platform input-output operations, handling files & networks, and support the event loop.

        <p class="faq-text">
          GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick are two popular tools for creating, editing, composing and converting images. Sharp is based on the ultra-fast libvips image processing library, and claims to be four to five times faster than ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick when it comes to compressing and resizing images. Sprite sheets are bitmap files that contain many different small images (for example icons), and they are often used to reduce the overhead of downloading images and speed up overall page load. A module that can help you here is validator.js. It provides several methods for validating strings, from isEmail() and isURL() to isMobilePhone() or isCreditCard(), plus you can use it on the server- and the client-side.<br> PDFKit supports embedding font types, embedding images and the definition of vector graphics, either programmatically (using a Canvas-like API) or by specifying SVG paths. <br> Cheerio is the answer. Although it implements only a subset of the core jQuery library, it makes processing HTML on the server side much easier. It is built on top of the htmlparser2 module, an HTML, XML and RSS parser. Plus, according to benchmarks, it's eight times faster than jsdom, another module for working with the DOM on the server side. <br> The CSV (comma-separated values) format is often used when interchanging table-based data. For example, Microsoft Excel allows you to export or import your data in that format. node-cvg simplifies the process of working with CSV data in JavaScript, and provides functionalities for generating, parsing, transforming and stringifying CSV. It comes with a callback API, a stream API and a synchronous API, so you can choose the style you prefer. <br> Markdown is a popular format when creating content for the web. If you ever wanted to process markdown content programmatically (i.e. write your own markdown editor), marked is worth a look. It takes a string of markdown code as input and outputs the appropriate HTML code. It is even possible to further customise that HTML output by providing custom renderers.

        What is EventEmitter in Node.js?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Event emitters are objects in Node.js that trigger an event by sending a message to signal that an action was completed. JavaScript developers can write code that listens to events from an event emitter, allowing them to execute functions every time those events are triggered. In this context, events are composed of an identifying string and any data that needs to be passed to the listeners.<br>
          Typically in Node.js, when we want to have an action occur upon completion of another action, we use asynchronous programming techniques like nesting callbacks or chaining promises. However, these techniques tightly couple the triggering action and the resulting action, making it difficult to modify the resulting action in the future. Event emitters provide a different way to structure this relationship: the publish-subscribe pattern. In this software architecture pattern, a publisher (the event emitter) sends a message (an event), and a subscriber receives the event and performs an action. The power of this pattern is that the publisher does not need to know about the subscribers. A publisher publishes a message, and it’s up to the subscribers to react to it in their respective ways. If we wanted to change the behavior of our application, we could adjust how the subscribers react to the events without having to change the publisher.

        What is recursion and give an example using javascript?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it doesn’t. And this technique is called recursion. <br>
          Suppose that you have a function called recurse(). A recursive function always has a condition to stop calling itself, otherwise, it will call itself indefinitely. Generally, recursive functions are used to break down a big problem into smaller ones. You can find that they are heavily used in the data structures like binary trees and graphs and algorithms such as binary search and quicksort. <br>
          function countDownFrom(number) { <br>
           if (number === 0) { <br>
             return <br>

          }<br>

          countDownFrom(5)<br>
          The recursive version doesn't need extra variables to track its progress. Notice how the pile of functions (call stack) grows as we recurse? <br>
          That's because each call to countDownFrom adds to the stack, feeding it number - 1. By doing this we're passing along an updated number each time. No extra state needed! <br>

        <p class="faq-text">
          An algorithm is a specific procedure for solving a well-defined computational problem. The development and analysis of algorithms is fundamental to all aspects of computer science: artificial intelligence, databases, graphics, networking, operating systems, security, and so on. Algorithm development is more than just programming. It requires an understanding of the alternatives available for solving a computational problem, including the hardware, networking, programming language, and performance constraints that accompany any particular solution. It also requires understanding what it means for an algorithm to be “correct” in the sense that it fully and efficiently solves the problem at hand.<br>
          An accompanying notion is the design of a particular data structure that enables an algorithm to run efficiently. The importance of data structures stems from the fact that the main memory of a computer (where the data is stored) is linear, consisting of a sequence of memory cells that are serially numbered 0, 1, 2,…. Thus, the simplest data structure is a linear array, in which adjacent elements are numbered with consecutive integer “indexes” and an element’s value is accessed by its unique index.

        What is scope / lexical scope in javascript?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript. The two types of scope are local and global: Global variables are those declared outside of a block. Local variables are those declared inside of a block.  JavaScript has lexical scoping with function scope. In other words, even though JavaScript looks like it should have block scope because it uses curly braces { }, a new scope is created only when you create a new function. A lexical scope in JavaScript means that a variable defined outside a function can be accessible inside another function defined after the variable declaration. But the opposite is not true; the variables defined inside a function will not be accessible outside that function.

          Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming is an ability to create a property, a function, or an object that has more than one realization. <br>
          Polymorphism is an ability to substitute classes that have common functionality in sense of methods and data. In other words, it is an ability of multiple object types to implement the same functionality that can work in a different way but supports a common interface.

        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that act on that data such that access to that data is restricted from outside the bundle, or as Alan Kay describes it, “local retention and protection and hiding of state-process.” In OOP, that means that an object stores its state privately, and only the object’s methods have access to change it. <br>
          If you want to change encapsulated state, you don’t reach out and directly mutate some object’s props. Instead, you call a method on the object, and maybe the object will respond by updating its state.

          A doubly linked list is a data structure where a set of sequential links of records called nodes exist.

        What is a Hash Table?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects.<br>
          In hashing, large keys are converted into small keys by using hash functions. The values are then stored in a data structure called hash table. The idea of hashing is to distribute entries (key/value pairs) uniformly across an array. Each element is assigned a key (converted key). By using that key you can access the element in O(1) time. Using the key, the algorithm (hash function) computes an index that suggests where an entry can be found or inserted.<br>
          Hashing is implemented in two steps:<br>
          An element is converted into an integer by using a hash function. This element can be used as an index to store the original element, which falls into the hash table.<br>
          The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.<br>
          hash = hashfunc(key)<br>
          index = hash % array_size<br>
          In this method, the hash is independent of the array size and it is then reduced to an index (a number between 0 and array_size − 1) by using the modulo operator (%).<br>
          Hash function:<br>
          A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.<br>
          To achieve a good hashing mechanism, It is important to have a good hash function with the following basic requirements:<br>
          Easy to compute: It should be easy to compute and must not become an algorithm in itself.
          Uniform distribution: It should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.<br>
          Less collisions: Collisions occur when pairs of elements are mapped to the same hash value. These should be avoided.<br>
          Note: Irrespective of how good a hash function is, collisions are bound to occur. Therefore, to maintain the performance of a hash table, it is important to manage collisions through various collision resolution techniques.

        Demonstrate Bubble Sort and explain when you might use it?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Bubble sort is an internal exchange sort. It is considered one of the simplest methods to sort an array of objects.  It is also known as a sinking sort (because the smallest items "sink" to the bottom of the array).<br>
          Instead of searching an array as a whole, the bubble sort works by comparing adjacent pairs of objects in the array.  If the objects are not in the correct ordered, they are swapped so that the largest of the two moves up.  This process continues until the largest of the objects, eventually "bubbles" up to the highest position in the array.  After this occurs, the search for the  next largest object begins.  The swapping continues until the whole array is in the correct order. A program needed a set of sprites sorted in depth order each frame. The spites order wouldn't change much between frames, so as an optimisation they were bubble sorted with a single pass each frame. This was done in both directions (top to bottom and bottom to top). So the sprites were always almost sorted with a very efficient O(N) algorithm.<br>
          First Pass:<br>
          ( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 )<br> Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.<br>
          ( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4<br>
          ( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2<br>
          ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) <br> Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.<br>
          Second Pass:<br>
          ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 )<br>
          ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2<br>
          ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )<br>
          ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 )<br>
          Now, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed. The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.<br>
          Third Pass:<br>
          ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )<br>
          ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )<br>

        Demonstrate Insertion Sort and explain when you might use it?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part. Insertion sort has a fast best-case running time and is a good sorting algorithm to use if the input list is already mostly sorted. For larger or more unordered lists, an algorithm with a faster worst and average-case running time, such as mergesort, would be a better choice.<br>
          An Example: <br>
          12, 11, 13, 5, 6<br>
          Let us loop for i = 1 (second element of the array) to 4 (last element of the array)
          i = 1. Since 11 is smaller than 12, move 12 and insert 11 before 12<br>
          11, 12, 13, 5, 6<br>

          i = 3. 5 will move to the beginning and all other elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.<br>
          5, 11, 12, 13, 6<br>

        Demonstrate Quicksort and explain when you might use it?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. </br>
          Always pick first element as pivot. </br>
          Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below) </br>
          Pick a random element as pivot. </br>
          Pick median as pivot. </br>
          The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time. </br>
          Pseudo Code for recursive QuickSort function : </br>
          /* low  --> Starting index,  high  --> Ending index */ </br>
          quickSort(arr[], low, high) </br>
          { </br>
              if (low < high){ </br>
                  /* pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now </br>
                     at right place */ </br>
                  pi = partition(arr, low, high) </br>

                  quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1) // Before pi </br>
                  quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high)// After pi </br>
              } </br>
          } </br>
          The way that quicksort uses divide-and-conquer is a little different from how merge sort does. In merge sort, the divide step does hardly anything, and all the real work happens in the combine step. Quicksort is the opposite: all the real work happens in the divide step. In fact, the combine step in quicksort does absolutely nothing. </br>
          Quicksort has a couple of other differences from merge sort. Quicksort works in place. And its worst-case running time is as bad as selection sort's and insertion sort's: <br>
          \Theta(n^2) </br>
          Θ(n2)\Theta, left parenthesis, n, squared, right parenthesis. But its average-case running time is as good as merge sort's: </br>
          \Theta(n \log_2 n) Θ(nlog 2n) \Theta, left parenthesis, n, log, start base, 2, end base, n, right parenthesis. <br>
          So why think about quicksort when merge sort is at least as good? That's because the constant factor hidden in the big-Θ notation for quicksort is quite good. In practice, quicksort outperforms merge sort, and it significantly outperforms selection sort and insertion sort. </br>
